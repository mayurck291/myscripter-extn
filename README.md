===============
<h1>Monkey Wrench</h1>

<h2>Monkey Wrench allows you to customise your favourite websites - Add your own CSS and run your JS scripts</h2>

Here's how it works...

1 ) Click on the New in top navigation bar to start creating your new RECIPE.
2 ) Provide the URL of the site on which you want your script to run
3 ) If you have some external JS files or CSS files to be included, such as jQuery, or your own hosted files, you can provide them in External JS & CSS sections. Provide them in the order in which you want them to be loaded
4 ) You can write your own JS and CSS code in the custom code section at the end. Once you are done, click on Save
That's it !! 

You are done! Now go to the site that you provided in step 2 and click on the Monkey Wrench icon and your script and CSS will take effect
Tip: If you don't want to click on the button every time, just tick the checkbox that says Run Automatically On Load
