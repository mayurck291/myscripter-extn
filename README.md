Monkey Wrench (a.k.a. myscripter-extn)
===============

Monkey Wrench allows you to customise your favourite websites - Add your own CSS and run your JS scripts

Here's how it works...

1 ) Click on the New in top navigation bar to start creating your new RECIPE.
<br>
2 ) Provide the URL of the site on which you want your script to run
<br>
3 ) If you have some external JS files or CSS files to be included, such as jQuery, or your own hosted files, you can provide them in External JS & CSS sections. Provide them in the order in which you want them to be loaded
<br>
4 ) You can write your own JS and CSS code in the custom code section at the end. Once you are done, click on Save
That's it !! 
<br>

You are done! 
Now go to the site that you provided in step 2 and click on the Monkey Wrench icon and your script and CSS will take effect

<i>Tip: If you don't want to click on the button every time, just tick the checkbox that says Run Automatically On Load</i>
