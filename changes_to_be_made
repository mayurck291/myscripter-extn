= DO NOT BREAK WORKING THINGS =

Reduce delay on click of menu of left

//Ability to add multiple external libraries - JS and CSS
//No HELP!!
//Show comment box or something that makes me realise that I can click to comment - not some arbitary
//Same for review
//Install button should be more actionable - so that it  becomes the primary button on the screen
//Give a back button or close button from the project edit screen to go to home page
//Make cancel button more visible
//Ability to remove projects from within the edit screen
//I should be able to import projects, not just export - because that makes no sense ;-)
//I should be able to fork my own projects
//I should be able to download all recipes, not just my own
//Export doesn't work - makes sense, considering there is no option to import
//Fork thing was weird - If you know what I mean
//Default name for project name should be empty
//Auto apply on by default
//Installed recipes should have both others' recipes and my own
//In recipe bazaar, show some text on clicking on recipe
//My recipes is not default tab, Installed recipes is...
//Code is broken - saved same project twice and two entries were made


TODO =>
Let's have tabs for popular, etc.
